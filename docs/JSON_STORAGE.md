# JSON Storage System for Bot Data Persistence

## Overview

The bot uses a JSON file to persist roster and team state across restarts. Previously, all data was stored in memory and would be lost when the process restarted.

## Persisted Data

The following data is now saved to disk:

1. **bench** - Players who joined using `/addme` (the bench/roster)
2. **teamA** - Home team (2-team split)
3. **teamB** - Away team (2-team split)
4. **team3A** - Team A (3-team split)
5. **team3B** - Team B (3-team split)
6. **team3C** - Team C/Extra (3-team split)
7. **tiensan** - Field rental cost
8. **tiennuoc** - Water cost
9. **teamThua** - Which team lost the match

## File Structure

The default runtime file is `.runtime/bot/storage.json`. You can override it with `BOT_STATE_FILE`.

```json
{
  "bench": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "teamA": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "teamB": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3A": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3B": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3C": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "tiensan": 0,
  "tiennuoc": 0,
  "teamThua": "HOME" | "AWAY" | null,
  "lastUpdated": "2026-03-28T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Map Storage Format

JavaScript Maps are stored as arrays of `[key, value]` pairs:

- **userId**: Telegram user ID or synthetic ID
- **playerData**: Object containing player information (name, username, etc.)

Example:

```json
"bench": [
  [123456789, "John (@john_doe)"],
  [987654321, "Jane (@jane_doe)"]
]
```

## Auto-Save Behavior

The storage system automatically saves to disk whenever:

- A player is added/removed from bench
- A team is modified (player added/removed)
- Field cost (tiensan) is updated
- Water cost (tiennuoc) is updated
- Team loss status (teamThua) is changed

## Files

- **`bot/utils/storage.js`** - Storage utility functions
- **`.runtime/bot/storage.json`** - Default runtime data (auto-generated, gitignored)
- **`bot/storage.json.example`** - Example data structure

## Usage in Code

The storage system is initialized in `bot/index.js`:

```javascript
const { initializeStorage } = require('./utils/storage');

// Initialize persistent storage
const storage = initializeStorage();
const { bench: members, teamA, teamB, team3A, team3B, team3C } = storage;

// Use getter/setter functions for primitive values
const getTiensan = storage.getTiensan;
const setTiensan = storage.setTiensan;
```

### Working with Maps

Maps work exactly as before, but automatically persist:

```javascript
// Add player to bench (auto-saves)
members.set(userId, playerData);

// Remove player from bench (auto-saves)
members.delete(userId);

// Clear team (auto-saves)
teamA.clear();
```

### Working with Primitive Values

Use getter/setter functions:

```javascript
// Get current value
const currentCost = getTiensan();

// Update value (auto-saves)
setTiensan(600000);
```

## Migration from In-Memory Storage

The bot will automatically:

1. Look for existing runtime storage on startup
2. Load data if found
3. Use default values if not found
4. Create the file on first data change

No migration script is needed. Just restart the bot and use it normally.

## Testing

To test persistence:

1. Start the bot
2. Run `/addme` to add yourself
3. Stop the bot
4. Check that the runtime storage file was created
5. Restart the bot
6. Run `/bench` - you should still see yourself in the list

## Troubleshooting

### Data not persisting

Check that:

- The bot has write permissions to the configured storage directory
- No errors in console logs when saving
- The configured storage file exists and is valid JSON

### Corrupted storage.json

1. Stop the bot
2. Delete the runtime storage file
3. Optionally copy `bot/storage.json.example` to the configured storage path
4. Restart the bot

### Manual data editing

You can manually edit the runtime storage file while the bot is stopped:

- Ensure valid JSON format
- Use proper array format for Map data: `[[key, value], ...]`
- Restart the bot to load changes
