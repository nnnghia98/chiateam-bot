# JSON Storage System for Bot Data Persistence

## Overview

The bot uses a persistent JSON file to keep next-match roster and team state across restarts. The file is owned by the bot runtime, and next-match data must always stay in it.

The default runtime file is `.runtime/bot/storage.json`. You can override it with `BOT_STATE_FILE`, but the data still belongs in that file-backed state.

Before risky implementation or deployment work, back up the file first so it can be restored if needed.

## Persisted Data

The following data is now saved to disk:

1. **bench** - Players who joined using `/addme` (the bench/roster)
2. **teamA** - Home team (2-team split)
3. **teamB** - Away team (2-team split)
4. **team3A** - Team A (3-team split)
5. **team3B** - Team B (3-team split)
6. **team3C** - Team C/Extra (3-team split)
7. **tiensan** - Field rental cost
8. **tiennuoc** - Water cost
9. **teamThua** - Which team lost the match

## File Structure

```json
{
  "bench": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "teamA": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "teamB": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3A": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3B": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "team3C": [[userId, playerData], ...],
  "tiensan": 0,
  "tiennuoc": 0,
  "teamThua": "HOME" | "AWAY" | null,
  "lastUpdated": "2026-03-28T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Map Storage Format

JavaScript Maps are stored as arrays of `[key, value]` pairs:

- **userId**: Telegram user ID or synthetic ID
- **playerData**: Object containing player information (name, username, etc.)

Example:

```json
"bench": [
  [123456789, "John (@john_doe)"],
  [987654321, "Jane (@jane_doe)"]
]
```

## Auto-Save Behavior

The storage system automatically saves to disk whenever:

- A player is added/removed from bench
- A team is modified (player added/removed)
- Field cost (tiensan) is updated
- Water cost (tiennuoc) is updated
- Team loss status (teamThua) is changed

## Files

- **`bot/utils/storage.js`** - Storage utility functions
- **`.runtime/bot/storage.json`** - Default runtime data (auto-generated, gitignored)
- **`bot/storage.json.example`** - Example data structure

## Usage in Code

The storage system is initialized in `bot/index.js`:

```javascript
const { initializeStorage } = require('./utils/storage');

// Initialize persistent storage
const storage = initializeStorage();
const { bench: members, teamA, teamB, team3A, team3B, team3C } = storage;

// Use getter/setter functions for primitive values
const getTiensan = storage.getTiensan;
const setTiensan = storage.setTiensan;
```

### Working with Maps

Maps work exactly as before, but automatically persist:

```javascript
// Add player to bench (auto-saves)
members.set(userId, playerData);

// Remove player from bench (auto-saves)
members.delete(userId);

// Clear team (auto-saves)
teamA.clear();
```

### Working with Primitive Values

Use getter/setter functions:

```javascript
// Get current value
const currentCost = getTiensan();

// Update value (auto-saves)
setTiensan(600000);
```

## Runtime Behavior

The bot will automatically:

1. Look for existing runtime storage on startup
2. Load data if found
3. Use default values if not found
4. Create the file on first data change

No migration script is needed. Just restart the bot and use it normally.

## Testing

To test persistence:

1. Start the bot
2. Run `/addme` to add yourself
3. Stop the bot
4. Check that the runtime storage file was created
5. Restart the bot
6. Run `/bench` - you should still see yourself in the list

## Troubleshooting

### Data not persisting

Check that:

- The bot has write permissions to the configured storage directory
- No errors in console logs when saving
- The configured storage file exists and is valid JSON

### Corrupted storage.json

1. Stop the bot
2. Restore the runtime storage file from a backup
3. If no backup exists, optionally copy `bot/storage.json.example` to the configured storage path
4. Restart the bot

### Manual data editing

You can manually edit the runtime storage file while the bot is stopped:

- Ensure valid JSON format
- Use proper array format for Map data: `[[key, value], ...]`
- Restart the bot to load changes

If the file is being changed for implementation or deployment work, make a backup first so the persistent next-match state can be restored exactly.
